Huber's great directions for building your own Light Box&lt;/a&gt;. So I built
my own light box based on Bill's design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got two 10 foot lengths of 1/2 PVC and the fittings Bill outlines.
Nancy picked up a couple yards of white cloth from the fabric store. I
went to a craft store and bought 10 different colored sheets of poster
board about 20&amp;quot; by 26&amp;quot;. I already had some goose neck desk type lamps
into which I put some compact fluorescent bulbs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I figured I'd size the box so that I could use the poster board oriented
in either direction. That made my pipes for the width and depth 28&amp;quot; by
22&amp;quot; (to leave room for the pipe going into the fittings). I made two
sets of legs at 12&amp;quot; and 16&amp;quot; long. I got to use my &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://agilitynerd.com/blog/agility/equipment/PVCCutter.html"&gt;PVC Cutter&lt;/a&gt; to
quickly cut the pipe. I didn't bother gluing any of the pipe together
since the friction fit is plenty tight enough. I also wanted to be able
to easily make the box smaller if I over estimated the size I would
need. It is a pretty sizeable box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Light Box with Backgrounds and Cover Sheet Pulled Back&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="thumbnail centered"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image0" src="http://data.agilitynerd.com/images/LightBox.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if you are looking to take photos for your blog or for selling items
on eBay this is a simple and inexpensive project. We'll see if it helps
my photos look nicer.&lt;/p&gt;
