Here are my `slides on Cypress E2E Testing <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wMR3n8WJAw7VeibSkosdXA2VRjtKNpDD4wRqOPKQElQ/edit?usp=sharing>`_
for a talk that I gave at the June `Northwest Chicago JavaScript <https://www.meetup.com/Northwest-Chicago-JavaScript/>`_ meetup.

I first tried `Cypress <https://www.cypress.io/>`_ when testing my `Agility Course Master <https://agilitycoursemaster.com>`_ hybrid mobile (`Ionic <https://ionicframework.com/>`_) application/website.
I was really impressed with how easy it was to install and use.
The thorough and well written documentation together with their online support further "sold" me on it for testing.

So I put together this talk on what I've learned. Here is video of my talk:
