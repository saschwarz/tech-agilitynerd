Here are my `slides about Using Gestures in Angular 2 Components <https://saschwarz.github.io/angular2-gestures-slides/#/>`_
for a lightning talk that I gave at the December `Northwest Chicago JavaScript <https://www.meetup.com/Northwest-Chicago-JavaScript/>`_ meetup.

The slides contain the TypeScript for two small Angular 2 components that demonstrate using the ``pan`` gesture to move a div around the screen,
allowing me to show the demo within the presentation itself.
Here's the `source code for the slides/components <https://github.com/saschwarz/angular2-gestures-slides>`_.

I have more examples of using gestures in the larger demo app I showed at the beginning of the talk:
`Angular 2 TypeScript Virtual Image Cropping repository <https://github.com/saschwarz/angular2-image-crop>`_.
