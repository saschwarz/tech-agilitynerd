Here are my `slides on Using Gestures in Angular 2 with TypeScript <https://saschwarz.github.io/angular2-gestures-slides/#/>`_
for a lightning talk that I gave at the December `Northwest Chicago JavaScript <https://www.meetup.com/Northwest-Chicago-JavaScript/>`_ meetup.

I converted the `Reveal.js <http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/>`_ slides checkout to use the
`Angular 2 CLI <https://cli.angular.io/>`_. That let me include two small Angular 2 components within the slides themselves.
Which also allowed me to demonstrate using the ``pan`` gesture without leaving the presentation. The Angular CLI also made it easy to
generate and publish the presentation to the GitHub pages associated with the slides via ``ng github-pages:deploy``.
Here's the `source code for the slides/components <https://github.com/saschwarz/angular2-gestures-slides>`_.

I have more examples of using gestures in the larger demo app I showed at the beginning of the talk:
`Angular 2 TypeScript Virtual Image Cropping repository <https://github.com/saschwarz/angular2-image-crop>`_.

Here is the video of my presentation:
