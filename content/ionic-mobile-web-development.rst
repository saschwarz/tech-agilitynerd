Here are my `slides on Using the Ionic Framework for Mobile and Web Development <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OmABc2JcqsPP3i6Q2EfYat-F6GKqGHjiUE2ywPcB09Q/edit?usp=sharing>`_
for a talk that I gave at the July `Northwest Chicago JavaScript <https://www.meetup.com/Northwest-Chicago-JavaScript/>`_ meetup.

I've been using `Ionic <https://https://ionicframework.com>`_ since early 2017.
I was drawn to it because it allowed a single code base to create native applications for both iOS and Android (with `Cordova <https://cordova.apache.org/>`_ providing the abstraction on top of the mobile platforms).
Ionic provides a set of platform styled widgets, integration and tooling to make it work together easily.
Their use of Typescript/Angular also meant I could create a purely web version of the application also using the same code.

Here is a video of my talk:
