After fixing a bug in these plugins I decided to add some new features:

-  The links generated by the favorites plugin used to display the path
   and filename of each popular article. It now displays the article
   title and the filename is displayed when hovering over the link. This
   makes for a much nicer looking and more useful display. Thanks to
   `Doug`_ for the `suggestion`_.
-  The hitcounter plugin now tests for existence of articles before
   adding them to its hash of counts.
-  Requesting a page which no longer exists deletes the page and its
   counts from the hash of counts. Since previous versions of this
   plugin would record non-existent pages they could appear in the
   favorites listing. So now you can delete them by clicking on the link
   in the favorites page.
-  As pages previously stored in the hitcounter hash of counts are
   visited their titles will be added so they will appear in the
   favorites' generated links.

Both plugins must be upgraded together and will upgrade the existing
hitcounter database as pages are accessed. The new versions can be
downloaded here:

-  `favorites`_
-  `hitcounter`_
