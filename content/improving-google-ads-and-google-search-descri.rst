I was looking at the google search results for my `Googility web site`_
and noticed that the descriptions shown underneath the title often
contained text from my navigation links instead of content from the body
of the page:


.. raw:: html

   <div class="thumbnail">

|Google_description|

.. raw:: html

   </div>

I did some searching and found the Google Webmaster blog post about
`description meta tags`_. Since almost all of the pages on Googility are
generated by fewer than a dozen Django templates I edited the templates
and inserted meta tags and filled the description in with data from each
database entry. This avoids boilerplate information that would be
ignored by Google and improves the descriptions shown to Google
searchers. Some of my pages have already been reindexed:

.. raw:: html

   </p>

.. raw:: html

   <div class="p_embed p_image_embed">

|Google_description_after|

.. raw:: html

   </div>

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Yahoo and some other search sites use a `class robots-nocontent`_ on any
page elements it should ignore for it's index, Unfortunately, Google
doesn't follow this standard. So I might end up making that edit to the
templates also. Looking at my site's log files it appears the Yahoo
spider is hitting my site more frequently than Google's and the Yahoo
index is more up to date. Looking at my analytics reports though Google
refers far more readers to my site than Yahoo...

I also noticed that the ads served on pages containing mostly links
appeared to be using words in my navigation or other boilerplate instead
of the few lines of valuable content. More searching to the rescue and I
found this `Google Adsense article on section targeting`_. Once again
editing the dozen or so templates I used were easy to edit to add in
these HTML comment tags. Checking back a couple days later showed
improvements in the ads being generated for those pages. I keep an eye
on my Adsense click rate and see if there is any increase in ad clicks.

So a couple simple edits made noticeable improvements not bad for a
couple hours investigation and implementation.
