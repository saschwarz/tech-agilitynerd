I have often been disappointed with the quality of photos of objects
I've posted on my site. My biggest problems have been providing good
lighting and a nice background (`see this for example`_). So I was
Googling to find a photographer's light box to build when I found `Bill
Huber's great directions for building your own Light Box`_. So I built
my own light box based on Bill's design.

I got two 10 foot lengths of 1/2 PVC and the fittings Bill outlines.
Nancy picked up a couple yards of white cloth from the fabric store. I
went to a craft store and bought 10 different colored sheets of poster
board about 20" by 26". I already had some goose neck desk type lamps
into which I put some compact fluorescent bulbs.

I figured I'd size the box so that I could use the poster board oriented
in either direction. That made my pipes for the width and depth 28" by
22" (to leave room for the pipe going into the fittings). I made two
sets of legs at 12" and 16" long. I got to use my `PVC Cutter`_ to
quickly cut the pipe. I didn't bother gluing any of the pipe together
since the friction fit is plenty tight enough. I also wanted to be able
to easily make the box smaller if I over estimated the size I would
need. It is a pretty sizeable box.

So if you are looking to take photos for your blog or for selling items
on eBay this is a simple and inexpensive project. We'll see if it helps
my photos look nicer.
