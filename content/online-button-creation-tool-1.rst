I was reading the `Blosxom`_ email list tonight and came across an
interesting `photoblog by Rob Park`_. After enjoying some of his photos,
I noticed his `post`_ about an `online form for creating the XML, RSS,
etc. buttons`_ popular on so many websites. `Adam Kalsey`_ has created a
simple (dare I say elegant?) form that gives you just enough inputs to
completely control the look of the buttons. The image is generated in
PNG format.

Had I known of this site before it would have saved me a couple hours
messing around with Fireworks creating the buttons on my AgilityNerd
`Feeds`_ page...
