In the last couple days my YouTube account has fallen victim to a new
scheme by porn websites attempting to garner Google Juice. It is pretty
straightforward. A generic YouTube account is created with a user name
like "babiegirl123xyz" and the "user" has a single line profile with the
line "all my pics are at the link below". The link is to an adult
sex/dating site.

All by itself creating a bogus YouTube account with a link to your site
won't get a site listed any higher in a Google search. But the clever
part of this approach is the "user" subscribes to many YouTube channels.
Since YouTube users often have channel pages with links to all of their
subscribers, the more subscriptions the bogus user creates; the more
incoming links they have to their profile and consequently to their
adult website. But I'd think the Google algorithm wouldn't weigh links
from YouTube too heavily anyway...

I came across this scheme because I got several subscription emails from
variants of the babiegirl accounts all with the same template of a
profile page and all linking to the same website. It doesn't really
matter much to me that they go to this trouble, but it is strange since
I don't display a list of my subscribers on my channel so they don't get
any real benefit.

I guess another way this scheme could help increase traffic would be
through the subscription emails. Heck I clicked on the links to see what
the site was about. It could be there are enough folks who do the same
in response to the subscription email. If only a few end up becoming
members of the adult sites it could make this a worthwhile means for
these sites to get more page hits/subscribers.

Sigh...
