Steve Schwarz has been a professional software developer since 1991. He started working in a team developing a distributed 3-tier client-server architecture in C/C++ on Solaris for near real-time assembly line monitoring and equipment control at Panasonic Factory Automation. That product is still in operation today.

Steve joined a small start-up: Trading Technologies, writing C/C++ client and server APIs for automated futures/options trading products in Visual Studio on Windows. He is an inventor on patents for price distribution algorithms.

Steve began full stack web development in Python, JS, CSS, HTML, etc. at another start up: Textura LLC. Over nearly a decade he helped take their flagship product from a monolithic web app serving a dozen clients to a multi-service modern architecture serving tens of thousands of clients around the world. Textura was acquired by Oracle in 2016.

Currently, Steve is freelancing in full stack web and mobile development using a range of web technologies.

For fun Steve loves playing and competing in dog agility with his dogs Snap! and Flyer.
