I've spent some time over the past couple nights trying to improve
the access to information on my site. As a software developer it is
often more fun to play around with the technology than it is to do
"real" work.

I've made the following enhancements:

-  Added Quick Links to the right hand navigation to allow folks to get
   to the three main Agility sections of the website without going to the
   `Navigate`_ page.
   Used the [[Blosxom]] `file plugin`_ to include the new HTML in all
   pages.
-  Changed my `AgilityGlossary`_ page to have a preface with an
   alphabetical listing ofdefinitions. I ended up using three new
   Blosxom plugins to make thiswork: `config`_, `postheadprefoot`_ and
   `sort_order`_.

For other Blosxom users I've updated my `site pluginspage`_ with the
details.

Hopefully these changes along with the page links and previous/nextpage
arrows at the bottom of the page will give everyone enough ways to move
easily around the sight.
