When my dog agility readers complained/were confused by the sprinkling of tech postings I split off tech.agilitynerd in another Blosxom instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once modern web hosted blogs came in to existence I wanted to see how they worked and moved the tech content to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://posterous.com"&gt;posterous&lt;/a&gt;. That was only OK, the source code formatting was painful but it did support email and web based content creation. I was reasonably content, not bugged enough to move again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then posterous announced &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.posterous.com/thanks-from-posterous"&gt;it is closing on April 30&lt;/a&gt; so I finally had to do something. This site really only needs a few features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;easy format in which to write content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;source code formatting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Atom/RSS feeds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;comments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use Disqus for comments on my other sites so that meant I could go with a statically generated site. Also since I primarily code in Python I wanted a platform to which I could contribute. I came across &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.getpelican.com/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; and it fit the bill nicely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I exported the posterous posts, imported them through a temporary wordpress.com site using their posterous importer and finally re-exported them in wordpress format. After a quick bug fix to the pelican wordpress importer I had reStructured Text files for each post. After a few days of editing the embeded source code in the content files and fixing long broken links, I had the blog running and not looking bad at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted a Twitter Bootstrap based responsive layout and I found &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/azizmb/pelican-bootstrap-responsive-theme"&gt;azizmb's pelican-bootstrap-responsive-them&lt;/a&gt; which had a very pleasing layout. I tweaked it to have category and tag feeds and some other enhancements to get what you see today. I will see if Aziz is interested in pulling any of my changes back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far I like using Pelican and I've made the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/saschwarz/tech-agilitynerd"&gt;content of the blog&lt;/a&gt; and my &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/saschwarz/pelican-bootstrap-responsive-theme"&gt;edits to the theme&lt;/a&gt; available on github in case anyone is interested.&lt;/p&gt;
