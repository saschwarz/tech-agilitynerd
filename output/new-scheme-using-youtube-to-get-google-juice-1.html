</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>In the last couple days my YouTube account has fallen victim to a new
scheme by porn websites attempting to garner Google Juice. It is pretty
straightforward. A generic YouTube account is created with a user name
like &quot;babiegirl123xyz&quot; and the &quot;user&quot; has a single line profile with the
line &quot;all my pics are at the link below&quot;. The link is to an adult
sex/dating site.</p>
<p>All by itself creating a bogus YouTube account with a link to your site
won't get a site listed any higher in a Google search. But the clever
part of this approach is the &quot;user&quot; subscribes to many YouTube channels.
Since YouTube users often have channel pages with links to all of their
subscribers, the more subscriptions the bogus user creates; the more
incoming links they have to their profile and consequently to their
adult website. But I'd think the Google algorithm wouldn't weigh links
from YouTube too heavily anyway...</p>
<p>I came across this scheme because I got several subscription emails from
variants of the babiegirl accounts all with the same template of a
profile page and all linking to the same website. It doesn't really
matter much to me that they go to this trouble, but it is strange since
I don't display a list of my subscribers on my channel so they don't get
any real benefit.</p>
<p>I guess another way this scheme could help increase traffic would be
through the subscription emails. Heck I clicked on the links to see what
the site was about. It could be there are enough folks who do the same
in response to the subscription email. If only a few end up becoming
members of the adult sites it could make this a worthwhile means for
these sites to get more page hits/subscribers.</p>
<p>Sigh...</p>
